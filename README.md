# Group 11 - Detailed Analysis of Airbnb Listing Data

- This title will definitely change over time.


## Topic of study :

We will be conducting an in depth analysis of Airbnb listings in Toronto. Why Toronto you ask? Well, it is a cool place to live and to explore. We wanted to focus on a Canadian city, and why not explore the home of the Raptors and the Blue Jays. The Airbnb market is interesting and eclectic, with many different stays and neighbourhoods. 


## About our Dataset :

- Who: Our data was provided by Inside Airbnb. These guys and gals sourced the data from publicly available information from the Airbnb site.

- What: This data is rich. We have 15084 listings, with details about : overall description, neighbourhood, hosts, host location, host response rates, superhosts, property type, # of bathrooms, # of bedrooms, # of beds, amenities, price, ratings, and reviews. 

- When: The data was collected August 6, 2021 for listings that appeared the month of July, 2021.

- Why: We are just curious about Toronto and the Airbnb listing details in the city. 

- How: The data was collected by Inside Airbnb, which is a mission driven activist project. Their goal is to provide data which puts into focus the impact of short-term rentals on housing / residential communities. They want to protect cities from adverse effects of short-term rentals. They verify, clease, analyse, and aggrgate the data themselves. 

## Topic/interest in this dataset :

- Purpose of analytical project: Although the columns of data by itself may seem rather basic and straighforward, trying to find a relationship between sets of data can provide a better understanding.
- Reason of interest: Especially during covid where travel restrictions were high, people were bounded domestically. Airbnbs are of interest for those who love to travel and explore.
- Research questions: How do ratings compare between super hosts and normal hosts? Does prices vary between the listings of superhost and normal host based on accomadation size and also comparision of clealiness of listings between both type the hosts.? How does the price and accommodation size relationship affect the review score?
